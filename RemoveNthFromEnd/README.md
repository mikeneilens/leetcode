Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.



__Example 1__:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2

Output: [1,2,3,5]

__Example 2__:

Input: head = [1], n = 1

Output: []
 
__Example 3__:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1

Output: [1]


__Constraints__:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
