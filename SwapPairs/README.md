Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

__Example 1__:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [2,1,4,3]

__Example 2__:

Input: head = []

Output: []

__Example 3__:

Input: head = [1]

Output: [1]

__Constraints:__

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
